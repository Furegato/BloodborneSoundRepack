# Bloodborne Sound Repack Guide
Extract and Repack Bloodborne sound files so that ShadPS4 can play them

Just unpack it and run the AutoRepack.ps1 Powershell Script. (Right-Click then "Run with Powershell")

If it's failing, try AutoRepack_Admin.ps1 which will resolve system permission problems.

Follow the script prompts and enjoy.
